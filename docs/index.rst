=============

Waffle is a feature-flipper for Django. It helps you run AB tests, roll out new
features to your users in a number of ways, sample data, and more.

Waffle has :ref:`three types of objects <objects-chapter>`: :ref:`Flags
<objects-flags>`, :ref:`Switches <objects-switches>`, and :ref:`Samples
<objects-samples>` that can be used to control the features of your website,
who sees them, and how they work.
